## How to install dependencies?

Run `pipenv install`.

## What is `pipenv`?

A virtual environment manager. Basically, it manages all of your installed libraries for you, so the local library versions don't conflict with your globally-installed Python libraries.

You might have used `requirements.txt` before. This is another way of managing your dependencies (libraries).

## I don't have `pipenv`
